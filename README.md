The project is an example of a web crawler in Python.
The package used is BeautifulSoup.

The input to the code is a base-url. The code then starts crawling the base-url and creates 2 files:
Crawled.txt and Queue.txt.

Crawled.txt keeps track of all the crawled web pages and queue.txt keeps track of all the web pages which will be crawled.

A check is given to not crawl on any web pages already crawled through the crawled.txt file.
